In Japan, medical expenses are based on fixed prices, so essentially the same amount is applied at medical institutions nationwide. While specific medical costs may vary depending on the tests, surgeries, or prescribed medications received, basic fees such as "initial consultation fees" or "follow-up/outpatient consultation fees" remain constant.
