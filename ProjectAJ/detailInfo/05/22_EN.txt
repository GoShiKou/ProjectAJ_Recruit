According to Article 19 of the Medical Practitioners' Act, a physician cannot refuse to provide medical care if a patient requests it, unless there are legitimate reasons to do so. Language barrier is not considered a legitimate reason for refusing treatment, so foreign patients also have the right to receive medical care.
